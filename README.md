# Modelling Passengers' Airport and Airline Choice Behavior

This is my academic project. Data, codes, and report are unable to be published due to privacy. 

## Problem

There are two international airports. One is smaller and old, but closer to the city, while the other airport is new and larger, but further from the city. We build models to identify what drives passengers’ choice of airport and airline. 

* Data: Survey data from 488 respondents
  * Socio-demographic: age, gender, occupation, income, etc
  * Alternative-Specific : flight information, travel time, mode of transport, etc
  
## Solution and Results

* Utilized Python to develop logistic regression and decision tree model with the goal of identifying passengers’ choice behavior from the survey data of 488 respondents, yielding the accuracy rate of 72%.
* Conducted data mining procedure including data processing, EDA, feature engineering, modelling, evaluating, and proposing recommendations to the airline companies based on passengers' behavior pattern.
