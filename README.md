# Modelling Passengers' Airport and Airline Choice Behavior

This is my academic project. Data, codes, and report are unable to be published due to privacy. 

## Problem

#### What drives passengers’ choice of airport and airline? 

Two international airports in Seoul Metropolitan Area: 
* Gimpo airport: Smaller and old, but closer to the city 
* Incheon airport: Larger and new hub airport, but farther from the city 

We developed models to investigate passengers’choice behavior. 

## Data description

* Data sets: 27 variables from survey data of 488 respondents
   * Airport choice: Gimpo, Incheon
   * Airline choice: Korean Air (KE), Asiana Air (OZ), Korean LCC, Foreign Carriers
   * Socio-demographic: age, gender, occupation, income, etc
   * Alternative-Specific : flight information, travel time, mode of transport, etc
  
## Solution and Results

#### A Classification Problem using Description Methods with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Models

* Utilized Python to develop logistic regression and decision tree model with the goal of identifying passengers’ choice behavior from the survey data of 488 respondents, yielding the accuracy rate of 72%.
* Conducted data mining procedure including data processing, EDA, feature engineering, modelling, evaluating, and proposing recommendations to the airline companies based on passengers' behavior pattern.
